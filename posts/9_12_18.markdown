# The Idea
## September 12, 2018

So, I will be making a game with Unreal starting now. Expect this initial idea to continuously change as I develop the game itself.

The idea is simple(ish):
- First person puzzle game
- You play as a druid
- Your job is to keep balance
- You have several powers:
1. Drain life
2. Give life
3. Blow spores
4. Plant seed

### Pacificsm

I was (and still am) really inspired by the pacificsm of Undertale. Ideally, I could replicate that amazing approach to interacting with npcs. In other words, rather than being constantly anatagonistic towards your enemies, you will solve puzzles to calm them.

### How might the powers interact?

Drain life takes the life out of something.
This could be used to sap away something alive *puzzle* or weaken an enemy trying to attack you *combat*.

Give life uses that life to fuel something.
This could give life to a golemn / grow a plant *puzzle* or kill an undead creature *combat*.

Blow spores creates spores which turn dead matter into useable life energy.
This could recycle energy from something dead *puzzle* or weaken an undead (or even alive) creature *combat*.

Plant seed plants a seed.
This could be used to grow something useful when supplied with sunlight, water and life *puzzle*.
This could also maybe be used as defense - think cactus / venus fly trap *combat*.

### How do life, death, and undeath work?

I imagine life and undeath being on opposite ends of a line with death being in the center.

Giving life would push you away from the center while taking life would push you towards the center.
