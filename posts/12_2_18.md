# Aesthetics
## December 2, 2018

So at some point I'll need to pick an aesthetic for the game. Ideally, its fairly minimilistic (because I'm only really a programmer) while also meshing with the nature themes of the game. The following are some images which I don't own but could help act as an inspiration for the aesthetic.

### Soma's Beauty

The look of the final area in Soma is simply amazing. Its super short and small but looks absolutely fantastic. Ideally, I could make a game that looks that good but given my lack of experience with environment design I'm not sure how realistic this look is. Either way, these pictures serve as an excellent "best case scenario" for how the game looks.

Here is some dreamy concept art:

### The Witness' Minimilism

The witness is a very good looking game given that it was made by 3 artists instead of a small team like with Soma. I don't think their aesthetic would work but I love how minimilistic everything looks. Ideally, I can avoid those straight polygon edges everywhere.
