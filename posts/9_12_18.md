# The Idea
## September 12, 2018

So, I will be making a game with Unreal starting now. Expect this initial idea to continuously change as I develop the game itself.

The idea is simple(ish):
- First person puzzle game
- You play as a druid
- Your job is to keep balance
- You have several powers:
1. Drain life
2. Give life
3. Blow spores
4. Plant seed

### Pacificsm

I was (and still am) really inspired by the pacificsm of Undertale. Ideally, I could replicate that amazing approach to interacting with npcs. In other words, rather than being constantly anatagonistic towards your enemies, you will solve puzzles to calm them or maybe just avoid them.

### How might the powers interact?

Drain life takes the life out of something.
This could be used to sap away something alive (*puzzle*) or weaken an enemy trying to attack you (*combat*).

Give life uses that life to fuel something.
This could give life to a golemn / grow a plant (*puzzle*) or kill an undead creature (*combat*).

Blow spores creates spores which turn dead matter into useable life energy.
This could recycle energy from something dead (*puzzle*) or weaken an undead (or even alive) creature (*combat*).

Plant seed plants a seed.
This could be used to grow something useful when supplied with sunlight, water and life (*puzzle*).
This could also maybe be used as defense - think cactus / venus fly trap (*combat*).

### How do life, death, and undeath work?

I imagine life and undeath being on opposite ends of a line with death being in the center.

Giving life would push you away from the center while taking life would push you towards the center.
In other words, you could damage the living by taking life or heal them by giving life, and for the undead you could damage them by giving life and *possibly* heal them by taking life.  I'm still unsure about the ability to take more life from something undead - that could allow you to gain "infinite" life from something dead.

### How does *Life energy* (name TBD) work

Currently, I like the idea of being able to drain life and give life with your abilities. An additional property I like of this *Life energy* is that you have increased health when storing more and less when storing less.

This could create some interesting puzzles in which you need to avoid damage for a while in order to carry as much *Life energy* as you can.

### Puzzle Ideas

- Gather enough life energy from the environment to awaken a golemn to move it - then maybe kill it?
- Decompose a battlefield with spores then use that energy to regrow the plant life.
- Revive a corpse by giving life in order to get some information
- Kill half of the rabbits in a garden to save it from being eaten (Thanos style!)
- Suck life out of choking vines to save trees - maybe chase the vines to their source?
- Keep something / someone alive with continuous life donations making it increasingly hard to find nearby life
- Fight a disease be isolating it - Kill and decompose trees on the border which could spread it
- Find bean seed, grow it to reach higher and higher to reach something
- Start a fire by creating tinder in right place - grow trees, decompose them, take their seeds and grow more trees
