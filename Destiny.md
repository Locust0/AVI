# Destiny 2 - Black Armory

![Output sample](https://github.com/Polaros/AVI/raw/master/gifs/bar_tilt.gif)

- Worked as a Design Intern at Vicarious Visions
- Most of my work was as a technical designer of the Black Armory Shield
- Also created the forge sabateur encounters - the introduction to the DLC
- May 2018 â€“ August 2018
- Worked with Grognok, Bonobo & Max

### Technical Design: Black Armory Shields

I created numerous variations of the black armory shield using Grognok and Bonobo. These shields are used in the Forge Saboteur encounters, in the forges themselves and in the quests to unlock the forges. The one above is the Tilt shield. The released versions include:
- Basic: which has the drones moving in a very perdictable pattern circling the target - its used as the shield around the crates in the sabateur encounters (but with only 1 drone), in the quest to unlock the Gofannon forge and as the final boss's shield in the Volundr forge
- Tilt: which has drones orbit target as if on a spinning plane - its used as the shield for all the sabateurs
- Teleport: which has the drones teleport higher or lower when damaged - its used as the shield for the final boss of the Gofannon forge

To create these shields, I worked with:
- Designers: to adjust and balance the shields and help them place the shields into the world
- Technical designers: to help me with the harder aspects of the shield
- VFX artists: to bring the shields to life
- 3D artists: to help conceptualize the look of the drones
- Programmers: to stop the drones from inheriting the rotation of their parent (target)
- Network engineers: to help me get the shields to work in a networked environment
- Animators: to move the drones in a way that would better work in networked conditions
- Quality Assurance: to fix the occasional bugs they would find

The initial prototype was given to me to iterate on and complete by another technical designer. I did just that and was soon given the reins to create as many cool variations of the shield as I could. I created many and 3 of the best made it into the game.

### Sabateur Encounters on Nessus & in EDZ

I created the gatekeeper (forge sabateur) encounter prefab which was used by myself and Leo Zuniga to place the gatekeepers into the world. The prefab also features the crates with the shields which spawn as well.

There are 2 sabateur encounters each on Nessus and in the EDZ.
