# De-Vampirication
## October 13, 2018

A problem I've noticed with the current mechanics is that you can feel a bit like a vampire.

Basically, because I've chosen abilities with mechanics in mind instead of story, I've inadvertently made a vampire instead of a druid. I still love the whole giving life thing but draining life out of things feels notably evil.



There are a couple of solutions to this that I've been considering:

<br />
<br />
<br />
### Drain Life doesn't affect animals

If I implement this, you can only drain plants.

Pros:
- Simple to implement
- Forces the player to be a pacifist

Cons:
- Removes ability to kill enemies
- You still feel a bit like a vampire
- Most of the levels would need to be plant-less to force life to be meaningful



### Drain & Give *water*

Pros:
- Easy to limit the resource (puddles)
- Would make sense taking water from most things

Cons:
- Might feel more like a waterbender than a druid
- Taking water from a plant (or even animal) would still feel kinda evil



### Scrap it

The main reason I decided to add this ability is to enhance the problem solving. This is supposed to be a puzzle / stealth game so I need some abilities to augment those things. But, if it turns out that this mechanic sucks I'll replace it with more thematic abilities.
