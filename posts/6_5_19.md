# BFS, A*, and Wall creation
## June 5, 2019

Above are a few algorithms that I recently implemented from scratch in my weird looping world. To deal with the fact that the world loops I developed two custom classes to handle all the looping for me.

- *WrappingPixel*: Named with the w_ prefix, it denotes a position in the level in terms of a pixel position. You can call the *up*, *down*, *left*, and *right* methods to get pixels in those directions which will loop appropiately.
- *Offset*: Named with the o_ prefix, it denotes a position in the level in terms of a vector with 0, 0 being the bottom left of the level. X increases to the right by 1 for each pixel. position 0, 0 is the bottom left corner of the pixel 0. Offset features the *Add* method which return a properly wrapped offset and the *Subtract* method which returns a Vector resulting from subtracting two offsets (wrapped appropiately)

*Wrapping Pixels* can be transformed into *Offsets* which can be transformed into actual positions in the world and positions can be transformed into *Offsets* and then into *Wrapping Pixels*.

My world is divided into 3 layers:

- *Solid*: which is completely impassable and never changes
- *Destructible*: which is completely impassable but can be destroyed
- *Magic*: which displays magical walls created by the player

With all that said, I can now discuss the algorithms which work in this world.

### BFS

The easiest of the algorithms I'll be discussing, it returns a list of Wrapping Pixels in range of a BFS given a collision mask and a range.

```c#
public List<WrappingPixel> BFS (WrappingPixel w_Start, int range, CollisionMask collisionMask)
{
    // List of pixels we've seen and should avoid rechecking
    List<int> visited = new List<int>();
    // List of pixels we are considering
    List<WrappingPixel> fringe = new List<WrappingPixel>();
    // List of pixels approved to be returned
    List<WrappingPixel> returned = new List<WrappingPixel>();

    fringe.Add(w_Start);

    for (int i = 0; i < range; i++)
    {
        // The fringe to consider for the next iteration
        List<WrappingPixel> tempFringe = new List<WrappingPixel>();

        for (int j = 0; j < fringe.Count; j++)
        {
            WrappingPixel w_Temp = fringe[j];

            // If this pixel is valid and not visited
            if (!visited.Contains(w_Temp.pixel) && CanEnter(w_Temp.pixel, collisionMask))
            {
                returned.Add(w_Temp);

                // Add the nearby pixels
                tempFringe.Add(w_Temp.up());
                tempFringe.Add(w_Temp.down());
                tempFringe.Add(w_Temp.left());
                tempFringe.Add(w_Temp.right());

                // Add this to the visited array
                visited.Add(w_Temp.pixel);
            }
        }
        // After looping through every pixel in this range, set the fringe to all potential candidates
        fringe = tempFringe;
    }
    // Return every valid pixel we found
    return returned;
}
```

If you've never seen a BFS, what this does is look at all pixels near *w_Start* in range of *range*. It avoids passing through anything which it's told to avoid in the *collisionMask*. It returns a diamond shaped segment of the world around the start unless a wall is blocking expansion in that direction.

A note about this algorithm, is that it will add pixels to the fringe regardless of weather they've already been added. The fix for this is to include the check in the *if* statement before every *tempFringe.Add* statement. This makes the code significantly more repetitive while not actually reducing the number of checks performed for each step. Either way each of those pixels needed to be checked.

This is used for finding the pixels affected by a bomb's explosion or the player's magic.

### A*

Next up is everyone's favorite pathfinding algorithm. It's fast and optimal so I of course needed it for my game's enemies. I won't include all the code for the actual algorithm because it's identical to every other implementation. The unique modifications to it which were needed to make it work in my game are below.

```c#
// This is how I handle wrapping. I use the wrapping pixel class to manage it for me
List<WrappingPixel> w_Neighbors = new List<WrappingPixel>();

if (CanEnter(w_Current.up().pixel, collisionMask))
    w_Neighbors.Add(w_Current.up());
if (CanEnter(w_Current.right().pixel, collisionMask))
    w_Neighbors.Add(w_Current.right());
if (CanEnter(w_Current.down().pixel, collisionMask))
    w_Neighbors.Add(w_Current.down());
if (CanEnter(w_Current.left().pixel, collisionMask))
    w_Neighbors.Add(w_Current.left());
    
// This is the heuristic I use for calculating the pixels to explore first
// It's the euclidian distance between two pixels in terms of their offsets
private float heuristic(WrappingPixel w_Start, WrappingPixel w_Goal)
{
    return w_Start.Offset().DistTo(w_Goal.Offset());
}
```

Here I made the game print the path it found from the player's position to the origin of the world using A*.

Then I made an enemy follow the path it found using A*. The way the enemy currently works is that it paths to the next waypoint whenever it reaches a waypoint. In this gif, I blocked its desired location (bottom left) when it reached its waypoint in the top right. This caused it to path downwards to avoid the magic before moving across.

### Wall Creation

This is the hard part of what I've been doing recently. In the above gif you'll notice that the solid layer is physically elevated and there is a grey wall which props it up. All of this was done with the help of the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsR0-wCTJl8&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eZgMK_DT5_biRkWXftAOf9&index=4).

This approach generates vertical walls. This works for small walls when viewed from the player's perspective which is always the top of the sphere. However, it isn't technically accurate. Ideally walls would look like this:

But how do I achieve this? With a more complex shader.
