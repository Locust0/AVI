# Shader Practice
## October 22, 2018

I've been learning how to make shaders with unreal by following a few tutorials online.

### Lava

The only animated shader, this shader uses 2 textures: a fire texture and a normal map along with 3 panning coordinates.

Essentially, a small fire texture is a base for the shader. Over that there is a mask which causes the lava to darken in places which correspond to the normal map of the object.

The normal map on the top is used as expected, to determine the light scattering on the surface of the object.

The middle texture is used as a base for the color emission of the lava.

The lower fire texture is panned across at the same rate as the normal map. The red colors of both are added to be used as a mask for the smaller lava texture.

There are 2 inputs (in light green) which correspond to the scale of the shader and its brightness. The cube in the center has its brightness turned up as an example.

### Ice

This is an awesome ice shader which has a nice blueish shimmer and icicles which are added dynamically.

This ice shader uses a randomized base color, randomized roughness (to make it appear imperfect / rocky), a combination of rock and sand as a normal map and a vertex shader to create icicles on the bottom.
