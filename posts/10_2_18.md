# Draining and Giving Life
## October 2, 2018

I managed to get a functional version of the life system working in-game. You can hold left click on a cube with the life component added to give it life or hold right click to take its life. Once it reaches 0 health, it is dead completely.

### Visual Scripting

I use the visual scripting system to cast a ray from the center of the screen forward when holding either left or right click. I look at what I hit and assign it and its life component to the C++ component.

Here's what the graph looks like:

![Raycasting](/images/player_raycasting.png)

A note on how to read this: Nodes are rounded boxes and the lines which connect them show inputs and outputs. This graph has a bunch of different variable types which are all denoted as differently colored lines: <span style="color:#5DADE2">Actors</span>, <span style="color:#F61530">Booleans</span>, <span style="color:#EAEAEA">Control Signals</span>, <span style="color:#8AE457">Floats</span>, and  <span style="color:#E5CE0C">Vectors</span>

Here is a list of the boxes (functions):

- <span style="color:#F61530">Event Tick:</span> &nbsp; Called every frame - propagates to all connected nodes to tell them to activate. When a node receives this signal, it checks its required inputs and forces all those nodes to evaluate before it activates.
- <span style="color:#F61530">Pressing Give Life:</span> &nbsp; Gets the player's script's variable *pressingGiveLife* and passes along that boolean value
- <span style="color:#F61530">Pressing Take Life:</span> &nbsp; Gets *pressingTakeLife*
- <span style="color:white">Branch:</span> &nbsp; Branches to the line trace if either *pressingGiveLife* or *pressingTakeLife* is true but not if both are pressed


- <span style="color:#4AA350">Get Player Camera's Manager:</span> &nbsp; Gets a reference to the player's camera
- <span style="color:#4AA350">Get Actor Location:</span> &nbsp; Gets that camera's location
- <span style="color:#4AA350">Get Actor Forward Vector:</span> &nbsp; Gets that camera's forward vector (center of the screen)
- <span style="color:#4AA350">Range:</span> &nbsp; Gets the variable range from the player's script - multiplied by the forward vector (which is normalized) to determine how far the raycast should go


- <span style="color:#397DD8">Line Trace By Channel:</span> &nbsp; Takes as inputs the camera's location and a distance forward from that position (determined by the forward vector * range)
- <span style="color:#4AA350">Break Hit Result:</span> &nbsp; Takes as input what we hit and outputs the specific Actor hit
- <span style="color:#4AA350">Get Component by class:</span> &nbsp; Takes as input the Actor hit and outputs its *Life Component*. If it doesn't have one, it instead outputs NULL


- <span style="color:white">Branch:</span> &nbsp; Branches to assign *target* and *lifeComponent* if we actually hit something, otherwise it will still assign those values, but this time to null
- <span style="color:white">Set (Target):</span> &nbsp; Sets the variable *target* in the player's script
- <span style="color:white">Set (Life Component):</span> &nbsp; Sets the variable *lifeComponent*. This variable is used when the script wants to actually call that component's functions to start taking or giving life (both functions below)

### C++ Coding

Below are the two main functions in the Life Component. The component stores the current life and other various options. When the player holds left or right click, they will call these functions on their target (if that target has this component).

Take life is simple, it takes in *amount* (how much life to drain per second) and converts that to *delta* which is how much to take per frame (assuming 60 FPS - this will be changed to be dynamic later). Next it checks if the Actor is alive and if it is, it sucks out life and returns how much was taken. If the Actor is dead, it returns 0.

```cpp
float ULife::TakeLife(float amount)
{
	//Frame-specific value to take
	float delta = amount * 1/60;

	// If alive
	if (life > 0)
	{
		float newLife = life - delta;
		// If alive and damaged
		if (newLife >= 0)
		{
			life = newLife;
			return delta;
		}
		// If alive and brought below 0 health
		else if (newLife < 0 && life > 0)
		{
			float temp = life;
			life = 0;
			
			//return exactly as much life as there was left
			return temp;
		}
	}
	//If dead
	return 0;
}
```


This function takes in *amount* and does the same delta conversion. Itâ€™s a bit more complicated because it can affect the undead. If undead and the life will bring the Actor to 0 (dead), the Actor will "die." If the target is alive, they will simply store the extra life.

```cpp
float ULife::GiveLife(float amount)
{
	float delta = amount * 1 / 60;
	// Not dead
	if (life != 0)
	{
		float newLife = life + delta;

		// If undead
		if (life < 0)
		{
			// If healed
			if (newLife < 0)
			{
				life = newLife;
				return delta;
			}
			// If brought above 0 life
			else if (newLife >= 0)
			{
				float temp = life;
				life = 0;
				return -temp;
			}
		}
		// If alive
		else
		{
			life = newLife;
			return delta;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```
