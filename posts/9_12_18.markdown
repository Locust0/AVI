# The Idea

So, I will be making a game with Unreal starting now.

The idea is simple(ish):
- First person puzzle game
- You play as a druid
- Your job is to keep balance
- You have several powers:
1. Drain life
2. Give life
3. Blow spores
4. Plant seed

### Pacificsm

I was (and still am) really inspired by the pacificsm of Undertale. Ideally, I could replicate that amazing approach to interacting with npcs. In other words, rather than being constantly anatagonistic towards your enemies, you will solve puzzles to calm them.
