# The Idea
## September 12, 2018

So, I will be making a game with Unreal starting now. Expect this initial idea to continuously change as I develop the game itself.

The idea is simple(ish):
- First person puzzle game
- You play as a druid
- Your job is to keep balance
- You have several powers:
1. Drain life
2. Give life
3. Blow spores
4. Plant seed

### Pacificsm

I was (and still am) really inspired by the pacificsm of Undertale. Ideally, I could replicate that amazing approach to interacting with npcs. In other words, rather than being constantly anatagonistic towards your enemies, you will solve puzzles to calm them.

### How might the powers interact?

Drain life takes the life out of something.
This could be used to sap away something alive (puzzle) or weaken an enemy trying to attack you (combat).

Give life uses that life to fuel something.
This could give life to a golemn / grow a plant (puzzle) or kill an undead creature (combat).

Blow spores creates spores which turn dead matter into useable life energy.
This could recycle energy from something dead (puzzle) or weaken an undead (or even alive) creature (combat).

Plant seed plants a seed.
This could be used to grow something useful when supplied with sunlight, water and life (puzzle).
This could also maybe be used as defense - think cactus / venus fly trap (combat).
