# Bombs, Magic and Dialogue
## May 8, 2019

I've been working hard writing some beautiful code this past week or so. I've added bombs which can be remotely detonated and leave realistic trails, magic which absorbs damage and looks awesome, and a new dialogue system.

### Bombs

First up, bombs. These move until they collide with something or are triggered with another click. They cost a bunch of mana and can't therefore be spammed. When they explode they perform a Breadth First Search at their position which respects the solid layer of the world. They then damage all damageable blocks including magic. This method of damage instancing means that only solid blocks prevent explosion damage and all other blocks are damaged as if they weren't there at all.

Recall that the player never moves, the environment does. So how does the bomb create a trail since its actual pattern of movement isn't in a straight line, its just made to appear as if it is? In the following gif I turned on an accurate trail which tracks the actual movement of the bomb in the world.

As you can see, the movement of the bomb must account for the movement of the player in order to appear as if it is moving in a straight line. To further this illusion, I wrote some code which forces the bomb's position to always be relative to the player instead of being relative to the world. I also wrote code which keeps track of the initial angle it was launched at and maintains that so the particle effect will always come out of the back of the bomb.

These two effects make the bomb appear to travel in a straight line.

Fun fact: I needed similar code to force the explosion of the bomb to appear to be stationary.

I also added the ability to blow up the bomb in mid-flight. When I implement enemies, I would like the player to be able to damage them with bombs. Ideally, a miss shouldn't remove all potential damage of that bomb (given how costly they are). The solution is that an additional left click detonates it.
