Aug 2017 â€“ Dec 2017 (Made with Unity and C#)

### Project Description
I created a game for the professor of my Computer Graphics class to get credit for the course. It is a 2D game which procedurally generates an obstacle course within an arena that some simple AI try to get through. You bet on how many will make it judging by the course created and are rewarded money based on how accurate your guess is.

### Code Examples
```c#

```
