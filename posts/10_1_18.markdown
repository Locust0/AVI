# Drain and Give Life
## October 1, 2018

I managed to get a functional version of the life system working in-game. You can hold left click on a cube with the life componenet added to give it life or hold right click to take its life. Once it reaches 0 health, it is dead completely.

### Visual Scripting

I use the visual scripting system to cast a ray from the center of the screen forward when holding either left or right click. I look at what I hit and assign it and its life component to the C++ component.

### C++ Coding

The C++ components to this system are the life component and the new parts to the player script.
